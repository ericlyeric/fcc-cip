// Create a Circular Queue
// In this challenge you will be creating a Circular Queue. A circular queue is a queue that writes to the end
// of a collection then begins overwriting itself at the beginning of the collection. This type of data structure
// is useful in certain situations. For example, a circular queue can be used for streaming media. Once the
// queue is full, new media data will overwrite old data.
// In this challenge we will implement a circular queue. The circular queue should provide enqueue and dequeue
// methods which allow you to read from and write to the queue. The class itself should also accept an integer
// argument which you can use to specify the size of the queue when created. We've written the starting version
// of this class for you in the code editor.

// When you enqueue items to the queue, the write pointer should advance forward and loop back to the beginning
// once it reaches the end of the queue. The enqueue method should return the item you enqueued if it is
// successful; otherwise it will return null.

// Likewise, the read pointer should advance forward as you dequeue items. When you dequeue an item, that item
// should be returned. If you cannot dequeue an item, you should return null.

// The write pointer should not be allowed to move past the read pointer (our class won't let you overwrite
// data you haven't read yet) and the read pointer should not be able to advance past data you have written.

class CircularQueue {
  constructor(size) {
    this.queue = [];
    this.read = 0;
    this.write = 0;
    this.max = size - 1;

    while (size > 0) {
      this.queue.push(null);
      size--;
    }
  }

  print() {
    return this.queue;
  }

  enqueue(item) {
    if (this.queue[this.write] === null) {
      this.queue[this.write] = item;
      this.write++;
      if (this.write > this.max) {
        this.write = 0;
      }
      return item;
    }
    return null;
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (this.queue[this.read] !== null) {
      let item = this.queue[this.read];
      this.queue[this.read] = null;
      this.read++;
      if (this.read > this.max) {
        this.read = 0;
      }
      return item;
